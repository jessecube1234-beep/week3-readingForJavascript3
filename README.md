## Questions

1. Why is dot notation generally preferred over bracket notation when accessing object properties in JavaScript?

     start = function() {
    // "this" is the car object
    console.log(this.brand + ' is starting.');
  }
};

car.start(); // Output: "Honda is starting."

```

4. How does the behavior of the this keyword differ when used in a function inside the global context compared to when it's used inside an object method?
